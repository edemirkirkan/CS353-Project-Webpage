            This proposal is for a database management system project which is about implementing a web-based Car Rental System. This proposal will contain a brief description of the application, establish functional and non-functional requirements, mention limitations, restrictions the technologies which we will be using while implementing the application. At the end of the proposal we will propose an E/R model for the database system. This system will be used by both the company’s employees and their customers.           </p>

            Description
        </h4>
        <p class = "first-text">
            This application will be a web-based system for customers to rent a car according to their driving experience. The system will be used by customers, employees, and managers. There will be a password for each user to log in to the system. For customers, we will require a driving license at the registration stage in order to control reservation requests suitable to customers' driving experience. After signing in or signing up, a customer can see the cars and can reserve the cars in the database with a smooth and easy-to-use UI. Moreover, a customer can make a request to have the car transferred to any city. After rental time ends the customer will be able to return the car to any branch. After the return, the customer will do a review about the rental experience and these reviews will be published to give an opinion to other users. Moreover, employees can also log in to the system to handle the transfer request and complete a reservation, employees will be able to see if there is a need for a penalty due to any damage to the car or if the deadline is passed.  Finally, managers will be able to use the system and they will be able to hire new employees and buy new cars and then add these employees or cars to the database.

            Objective
        </h4>
        <p class = "first-text">
            In the database system project, we are going to implement a web-based Car Rental System which will imitate a real life car rental system. While implementing the database and the application layer we intend to use the best practices followed by many other developers around the world. Implemented system will be used by both the company's employees and the customers. The main goals of this web-based system are as follows:
          </p>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class = "first-text">To offer customers an easy to use car rental service where they can choose from a wide range of options.</li>
            <li class = "first-text">To offer customers different branches that they can rent cars suitable for their taste and driving experience.</li>
            <li class = "first-text">To offer customers an easy renting experience with an easy to use UI, online payment with flexible return and pick-up locations.</li>
            <li class = "first-text">To improve the system and customers experience,  a review system where each customer can give feedback about their rental experience. </li>
            <li class = "first-text">To offer  employees an easy to use management platform where they can manage their daily tasks.</li>
            <li class = "first-text">To offer an easy monitoring system for reservations such as monitoring ending and starting dates, and charge a penalty for excess time and for damage of cars if needed.</li>
            <li class = "first-text">To help managers to hire new employees from the job offerings section, and buy new cars by adding them to the database.</li>
            <li class = "first-text">To provide an admin panel where managers and employees can access the database.</li>
        </ul>

            Why & How
        </h4>
        <h4 class = "third-title">
            Why a database system will be used?
        </h4>
        <p class = "second-text">
            To keep the data of various elements of the car rental system such as cars, customers, reservations, employees and managers, we are in need of a database system. We are using a database system instead of a file system because with the usage of database systems it is much easier to keep data and access to the data later, and also it is faster. Moreover, by having a database we are able to have limitations on the data, and we can visualize the data organization by using relational model and entity-relationship model.          </p>
        </p>
        <h4 class = "third-title">
            How a database system will be used?
        </h4>
        <p class = "second-text">
            Relational schema will be used  to keep track of main tables, and to determine relation between tables, foreign keys, the Entity-Relationship model diagram will be used that can be found in section five of this paper. Using this relational schema and structured query language, PostgreSQL database will be created. Finally, we will manage, modify, and keep track of the application's data using the car rental system database.        </p>
